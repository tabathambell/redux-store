# Redux Store

## Description
This project was challenging in the aspect of having to research the topic on our own. Redux wasn't exactly as hard as I had expected it to be. There were a few roadblocks that I had faced while doing this assignment -- namely figuring out that I hadn't initialized the state. Little things tend to trip me up on this instance. 

This project was meant to use Redux in order to have a fully operational store using Stripe. From the main page, there is a selection of products for sale. When you hit 'add to cart', its ends it to the cart and you are able to check out and go to the payment page where Stripe is initiated.
